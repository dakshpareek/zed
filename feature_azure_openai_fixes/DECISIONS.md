# Azure OpenAI Integration Fixes - Decision Log

## âœ… Current Agreed Decisions (Updated: 2025-01-02)

- **Primary Issues Identified**: Response streaming cutoffs and tool recognition failures âœ… RESOLVED
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Multiple differences between Azure OpenAI and regular OpenAI implementations âœ… COMPLETED
- **Fix Strategy**: Address parsing, error handling, and model capability detection âœ… IMPLEMENTED
- **Compilation Issues**: Fixed lifetime and syntax errors âœ… RESOLVED

## ðŸ“Œ Decision History

### ðŸ“… 2025-01-02 - Critical Fixes Completed âœ…
- **Decision**: All Phase 1 critical fixes successfully implemented and tested
- **Reasoning**: Stream processing, tool support, and error handling improvements address core issues
- **Completion Status**:
  1. âœ… Stream response parsing with robust error handling
  2. âœ… Model-aware tool support detection (o1 models properly excluded)
  3. âœ… Enhanced logging and debug capabilities
  4. âœ… Lifetime compilation error fixed in azure_openai.rs
  5. âœ… Syntax error fixed in settings.rs (missing closing brace)
  6. âœ… Full project compilation verified with `cargo check`

### ðŸ“… 2025-01-02 - Initial Issue Analysis
- **Decision**: Investigate Azure OpenAI vs OpenAI implementation differences
- **Reasoning**: User reports indicate Azure integration has issues while OpenAI works fine
- **Issues Found**:
  1. âœ… FIXED: Missing proper JSON parsing error handling in streaming
  2. âœ… FIXED: Lack of logging for debugging malformed responses
  3. âœ… FIXED: Tool capability detection ignoring model-specific limitations
  4. âœ… FIXED: Poor error propagation causing stream termination
  5. âœ… FIXED: Compilation errors preventing build

### ðŸ“… 2025-01-02 - Architecture Alignment
- **Decision**: Align Azure OpenAI implementation patterns with working OpenAI provider
- **Reasoning**: OpenAI provider demonstrates robust patterns that should be mirrored
- **Changes Made**:
  - âœ… Implemented graceful JSON parsing like OpenAI provider
  - âœ… Added model-specific capability checking
  - âœ… Enhanced error handling and context preservation
  - âœ… Fixed compilation issues for successful deployment

### ðŸ“… 2025-01-02 - Error Handling Strategy
- **Decision**: Implement comprehensive error handling without breaking streaming
- **Reasoning**: Current implementation terminates streams on any parse failure
- **Implementation**: âœ… COMPLETED
  - Continue streaming on malformed JSON chunks
  - Log warnings for debugging without breaking user experience
  - Preserve error context for troubleshooting
  - Azure-specific error response parsing

### ðŸ“… 2025-01-02 - Model Capability Detection
- **Decision**: Implement dynamic tool support detection based on model capabilities
- **Reasoning**: o1 models don't support tools, but Azure provider advertised support for all models
- **Implementation**: âœ… COMPLETED
  - Model-specific `supports_tools()` logic
  - Parallel tool calls validation for compatible models
  - Consistent behavior with OpenAI provider
